We’re hiring! 
 
Seeking a full stack engineer who’s excited about open source, making communities sustainable, and transparent finances.

### We think you’d be great at this if you: 

 - Have experience in a full time full stack engineer position using JavaScript.
 
 - Are comfortable in a remote environment that is at the same time highly collaborative (we [apply](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues/2267) a [seeking feedback process](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making)) and autonomous (you can run a feature end to end on your own!) 
 
 - You are able to contribute to our two main stacks:  GraphQL API (powered by Node and PostgreSQL) and our Web App (powered by Next.js, React and Apollo).
 
 - You are excited about contributing to our mission! 

Like the movements that we support, we value openness and transparency. We strive to create inclusive, respectful and sustainable communities and we're 100% Open Source. If you want to know more about us, you can already join our [Slack](https://slack.opencollective.com) and check out the [Open Collective Way](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/the-open-collective-way) to learn more about how we operate and what we stand for.

We are a fully remote team - with team members in New Zealand (Wellington), Mexico (Guadalajara), Spain (Madrid), Belgium (Brussels), Germany (Berlin) and France (South Coast).
