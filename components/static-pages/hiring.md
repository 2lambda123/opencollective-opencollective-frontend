<h2 id='software-engineer'>Senior, 'Full Stack' Software Engineer</h2>

We are looking for a senior full-stack engineer who’s excited about open source, making communities sustainable, and transparent finances.

### We think you’d be great at this if you:

- Are comfortable in a remote environment that is at the same time highly collaborative (we [apply](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues/2267) a [seeking feedback process](https://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/theory/decision-making/)) and autonomous (you can run a feature end to end on your own!)

- Are based within 6 hours of Central European Time:

  - to optimize timezone overlaps with the current engineering team (who are predominantly based in Europe)

- Have significant experience as a full stack engineer using JavaScript (<em>"senior"</em>)

- Are familiar with the technologies used in our two main projects:

  - our GraphQL API (powered by Node, PostgreSQL and Sequelize)
  - our Web App (powered by Next.js, React and Apollo).

- You are excited about our mission and share our philosophy.

<h2 id='product-manager'>Senior Product Manager</h2>

We are looking for a senior product manager who is excited about creating a world in which it is as rewarding and financially secure to build and maintain software for the commons as it is for the corporation.

### We think you’d be great at this if you:

- Are comfortable in a remote environment that is at the same time highly collaborative (we [apply](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues/2267) a [seeking feedback process](https://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/theory/decision-making/)) and autonomous (you will own complete features and products!)

- Are based within 4 hours of Central European time:

  - to optimize timezone overlaps with the current product team (who are based in the UK)

- Have significant experience as a product manager in a software business (<em>"senior"</em>) i.e. a digital platform or product organisation.

- Are comfortable with the processes, tools and trade-offs required to build and maintain products as a small team, with minimal support, including but not limited to:

  - conducting, interpreting and conveying the results of user and market research, both quantitative and qualitative (we use Metabase and Matomo)
  - building context for and collaborating with design and engineering to develop, scope, prioritize, execute, test and iterate on solutions
  - documenting, releasing, marketing and supporting products after launch
  - supporting leadership to make effective strategic decisions on product development and success.

- You have experience working within or adjacent to open source communities, are excited about our mission, and share our philosophy.
