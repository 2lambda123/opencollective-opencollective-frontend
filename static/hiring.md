### We think you’d be great at this if you: 

 - Are comfortable in a remote environment that is at the same time highly collaborative (we [apply](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues/2267) a [seeking feedback process](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making)) and autonomous (you can run a feature end to end on your own!) 

 - Are based in Europe:
   - to optimize timezone overlaps with the current engineering team (CET)
   - for easy traveling to cities like Paris, Madrid, Berlin or Brussels (a few times a year)

 - Have experience in a full time full stack engineer position using JavaScript

 - Are familiar with the technologies used in our two main projects:
  - our GraphQL API (powered by Node, PostgreSQL and Sequelize)
  - our Web App (powered by Next.js, React and Apollo).
 
 - You are excited about contributing to our mission! 

Like the movements that we support, we value openness and transparency. We strive to create inclusive, respectful and sustainable communities and we're 100% Open Source. If you want to know more about us, you can already join our [Slack](https://slack.opencollective.com) and check out the [Open Collective Way](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/the-open-collective-way) to learn more about how we operate and what we stand for.

We are a fully remote team - with team members in New Zealand (Wellington), Mexico (Guadalajara), Spain (Madrid), Belgium (Brussels), Germany (Berlin) and France (South Coast).
