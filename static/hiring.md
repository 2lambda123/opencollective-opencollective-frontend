Big task! We know. That’s why we are looking to grow our team and add a full stack engineer to help us develop the tools these communities need to thrive.  

We think you’d be great at this if you 

 - Have experience in a full time position in the past. 
 - You are comfortable in a remote environment that is at the same time autonomous (you can run a feature end to end on your own) and highly collaborative (we apply a  seeking feedback process). 
 - Know JavaScript 
 - You are able to contribute indifferently to our two main stacks:  GraphQL API (powered by Node and PostgreSQL) and our Web App (powered by Next.js, React and Apollo).
 - You are excited about contributing to our mission! 

Like the movements that we support, we value openness and transparency. We strive to create inclusive, respectful and sustainable communities. You can find links to our transparent budget, board minutes, case studies, and Collective pages (whose budgets are all transparent too).

We're 100% Open Source, so everything you will be doing will be Open Source. If you want to know more about us, you can already join our Slack and check out the Open Collective Way to learn more about how we operate and what we stand for. 

We are a full remote team - with team members in New Zealand (Wellington), Mexico (Guadalajara), Spain (Madrid), Belgium (Brussels), Germany (Berlin) and France (South Coast).
