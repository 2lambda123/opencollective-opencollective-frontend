# Hiring

We’re hiring! 
 
Seeking a full stack engineer who’s excited about open source, making communities sustainable and transparent finances.  

Open Collective is on a mission to help communities around the world be sustainable. On Open Collective, groups like open source projects, meetups, political and grass-roots movements can collect and spend money transparently; invite others to collaborate and make their communities thrive.

Big task! We know. That’s why we are looking to grow our team and add a full stack engineer to help us develop the tools these communities need in order to thrive.  

We think you’d be great at this if you: 

 - Had experience in a full time position in the past. 
 
 - Are comfortable in a remote environment that is at the same time highly collaborative (we [apply](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues/2267) a [seeking feedback process](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making)) and autonomous (you can run a feature end to end on your own!) 
 
 - Know JavaScript.  
 
 - You are able to contribute indifferently to our two main stacks:  GraphQL API (powered by Node and PostgreSQL) and our Web App (powered by Next.js, React and Apollo).
 
 - You are excited about contributing to our mission! 

Like the movements that we support, we value openness and transparency. We strive to create inclusive, respectful and sustainable communities. You can find [links](https://drive.opencollective.com) to our transparent budget, investor updates, case studies, and Collective pages (whose budgets are all transparent too).

We're 100% Open Source, so everything you will be doing will be Open Source! If you want to know more about us, you can already join our [Slack](https://slack.opencollective.com) and check out the [Open Collective Way](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/the-open-collective-way) to learn more about how we operate and what we stand for. 

We are a full remote team - with team members in New Zealand (Wellington), Mexico (Guadalajara), Spain (Madrid), Belgium (Brussels), Germany (Berlin) and France (South Coast).

Want to apply?
